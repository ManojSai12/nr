Comparative Analysis of Weighted Images and Binary Masks
To quantify and understand the evolution of cloud cover over the years (2000 to 2023), a comparative analysis is conducted between the weighted images representing each month and the corresponding binary mask images. This process involves assessing pixel differences to identify cloud-free and cloudy areas across different temporal snapshots.

Methodology:
Weighted Image Formation:

For each month, a weighted image is generated by multiplying the pixel values of the grayscale image with the corresponding weight assigned to the specific year. This creates a temporal representation of the landscape, emphasizing the impact of each year's data.
Binary Mask Comparison:

Simultaneously, binary mask images are derived by applying predefined thresholds to the grayscale images. These masks categorize pixels as either cloud-free or cloudy based on the selected intensity thresholds.
Pixel-Level Comparison:

The pixel values of the weighted images are compared with the corresponding pixel values of the binary masks for the same month. This pixel-level comparison serves as the basis for identifying areas where the weighted image and binary mask agree or disagree.
Accumulation of Pixel Differences:

To quantify the pixel differences, a cumulative approach is adopted. If the pixel values in the weighted image and binary mask for a specific month agree, the corresponding pixel value is added to the cumulative difference. This process is repeated for all months and years under consideration.
Significance:
Identifying Cloud-Free Regions:

Consistent agreement between the weighted images and binary masks indicates cloud-free regions. These areas exhibit stability in cloud cover patterns across the selected years.
Detecting Dynamic Cloud Cover:

Areas with varying pixel values highlight dynamic cloud cover patterns. Discordance between the weighted images and binary masks reveals regions susceptible to changing weather conditions over the years.
